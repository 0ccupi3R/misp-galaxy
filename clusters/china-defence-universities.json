It consists of more than 200 subordinate enterprises and research institutes, many of which are listed on the Nuclear Threat Initiative website. In 2018, CNNC took over China's main nuclear construction company, China Nuclear Engineering and Construction Group (中国核工业建设集团).The company is organized into eight industrial sectors, including nuclear power, nuclear power generation, nuclear fuel, natural uranium, nuclear environmental protection, application of nuclear technologies, non-nuclear civilian products and new energy sources. CNNC is mainly engaged in research and development, design, construction and production operations in the fields of nuclear power, nuclear fuel cycle, nuclear technology application, and nuclear environmental protection engineering.Because of the dual-use nature of nuclear technologies, the nuclear industry is a typical military-civil fusion industry. Naval nuclear power technology and nuclear reactor technology in the reactor core, fuel assembly, safety and security, and radioactive waste treatment all use the same or very similar processes. In March 2019, CNNC established an military-civil fusion fund dedicated to dual-use nuclear technology research and design.Two CNNC subsidiaries have been added to the US Government's Entity List, restricting exports to them on national security grounds.CNNC has cooperated with U.S. Westinghouse Electric to construct AP1000 nuclear power plants.

Notably, Mianyang is home to a military-civil fusion (MCF) demonstration base—the Sichuan Mianyang High-Technology City. Sichuan Military District Commander Jiang Yongshen (姜永申) in 2016 stressed the important role that Mianyang plays in China's larger science and technology development and the significance of its military-civil fusion (MCF) demonstration base.The academy is best known for nuclear weapons, but also carries out research on directed-energy weapons. CAEP's four main tasks are to develop nuclear weapons, research microwaves and lasers for nuclear fusion ignition and directed-energy weapons, study technologies related to conventional weapons, and deepen military-civil fusion. It claims that its research covers 260 specialising, primarily in the broad areas of physics and mathematics, mechanics and engineering, materials and chemistry, electronics and information, and optics and electrical engineering.CAEP hosts part of the Tianhe-2 supercomputer, one of the worlds fastest supercomputers.Despite the sensitivity of its work, CAEP has expanded its international presence in recent years. It claims to send hundreds of scientists overseas to study or work as visiting scholars. CAEP has also used Chinese government talent recruitment schemes such as the Thousand Talents Plan to recruit dozens of scientists from abroad. By 2015, CAEP had recruited 57 scholars through the Thousand Talents Plan, making it one of the largest recruiters of Thousand Talents Plan scholars.CAEP maintains strong collaborative relationships with Chinese civilian universities. It runs a joint laboratory with the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and collaborates with universities and research institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Science and Technology of China, Shandong University, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Sichuan University, Jilin University, Peking University and Tsinghua University.

However its involvement in defence research does not appear as expansive as the other B8 members and it is a relatively low-ranked university. In 2017, its president stated that ‘Chongqing is an important site for the weapons industry, but its military-industrial research and development ability has not yet upgraded.' Unlike the other members of the B8, SASTIND does not appear to supervise the university.The university has links to Norinco Group and China South Industries Group, China's largest weapons manufacturers, and was under the supervision of the conglomerates' predecessor, China Ordnance Industry Corporation, until 1999. In 2017 and 2018, it signed a partnerships with four local defence companies to collaborate on research and training.In 2011, CQUT received secret-level security credentials, enabling it to participate in classified defence projects.",

      "description": "COMAC was established in 2008 as a state-owned manufacturer of large commercial aircraft. The company oversees eleven subsidiaries that focus on various aspects of aircraft production. A list of COMAC's subordinate companies can be found in English on the company's website.Despite its focus on commercial aircraft, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has referred to it as a defence industry conglomerate. The company maintains strong links to China's defence industry and some of its leadership is drawn from former executives at state-owned military aircraft and missile manufacturers. China's leading producer of military aircraft, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), also holds a 10 per cent share in COMAC. COMAC supports the continued development of China's defence industry by awarding ‘national defence technology scholarships' to Chinese university students.COMAC's signature passenger aircraft, the C919, offers an example of how the company could use its civilian aircraft production for military purposes. Numerous Chinese analysts have studied Boeing's conversion of the 737 into the P-8 Poseidon and E-7A surveillance aircraft and argue that the C919 could also be retrofitted for early warning as well as anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare missions. With a greater flight range than China's other military aircraft, a retrofitted C919 for maritime surveillance operations could reduce China's dependence on artificial air bases in the South China Sea which currently render aircraft vulnerable to corrosion due to harsh weather conditions. Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Zhang Youxia, reportedly expressed an interest in learning from American companies in converting civilian aircraft into military aircraft while inspecting COMAC's C919.

HEU's achievements include producing China's first experimental submarine, ship-based computer, and hovercraft. The university claims to have participated in most of the PLA Navy's submarine, undersea weapon, and warship projects.HIT's role in the defence industry is highlighted by its formal affiliation with the PLA Navy, which became a supervising agency of the university in 2007. Under the supervisory agreement, the PLA Navy committed to developing HEU's capacity as a platform for research and development in military technology and for training defence personnel. The following year, HEU established a Defence Education Institute to train reserve officers. Since then, the institute has trained at least 1,700 officers. HEU also maintains a joint laboratory with the PLA Navy Coatings Analysis and Detection Center.HEU is an important hub research on nuclear engineering, including on nuclear submarines. In 2018, it signed a co-construction agreement with defence conglomerate China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). In 2019, HEU and CNNC established the China Nuclear Industry Safety and Simulation Technology Research Institute. HEU also runs a joint laboratory on energetic materials (such as explosives) with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics, China's nuclear warhead research organisation.\n",

In 2018, HIT spent RMB1.97 billion (AUD400 million)—more than half of its research budget—on defence research. 29.96% of the university's graduates that year who found employment were working in the defence sector.HIT has been described by Chinese state media as having ‘defence technology innovation and weapons and armaments modernisation as its core'. It excels in satellite technology, robotics, advanced materials and manufacturing technology, and information technology. Other areas of defence research at HIT include nuclear technology, nuclear combustion, nuclear power engineering and electronic propulsion and thruster technology, many of which are officially designated as skill shortage areas for the Chinese defence industry.HIT is best known for its aerospace research and has a close relationship with China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), a state-owned defence company that specialises in long-range ballistic missile and satellite technology. Since 2008, HIT and CASC have operated a joint research centre. Defence conglomerates CASC, CASIC, AVIC and CETC rank among the top employers of HIT graduates. The university is a major source of cyber talent and receives funding for information security research from the MSS, China's civilian intelligence agency. A report prepared for the US–China Security and Economic Review Commission identified it as one of four universities focused on research with applications in information warfare.

      "description": "HLJIT is an engineering-focused university that engages in growing levels of defence research. In 2015, the Heilongjiang Provincial Government partnered with defence industry agency SASTIND to expand the university's ability to ‘show its national defence characteristics and serve the national defence science and technology industry.'SASTIND has designated military-use power and energy, optoelectronics and laser technology, and computing as three ‘disciplines with national defence characteristics' at HLJIT. In June 2016, HLJIT and ZTE jointly launched an MOE-ZTE ICT Product-Teaching Integration Innovation Base (教育部-中兴通讯ICT产教融合创新基地) and established the Heilongjiang School of Engineering-ZTE Information and Communications Technology College (黑龙江工程学院-中兴信息通信技术学院). ZTE has been reportedly barred from US government contracts.As it increases its implementation of military-civil fusion, HLJIT has developed relationships with defence conglomerates. The university is particularly close to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), a leading state-owned manufacturer of long-range missiles and satellites. In 2017, HLJIT partnered with a subsidiary of CASC to establish a joint research centre, the Aerospace Smart City Research Institute. The subsidiary, Aerospace Shenzhou Smart System Technology Co., Ltd. (航天神舟智慧系统技术有限公司), specialises in smart city and informatization technology.HLJIT holds confidential-level security credentials, allowing it to participate in confidential defence technology projects.",

      "description": "JLU is directly under the administration of the Ministry of Education and came under the joint supervision of the ministry and defence industry agency SASTIND in 2016. In 2017, SASTIND designated eight fields of research at JLU as national defence disciplines, indicating the university carries out high levels of defence research.  In 2012, JLU spent roughly RMB60 million (AUD12.5 million) on defence research, a number that is likely to have grown substantially.JLU's National Defense Science and Technology Research Institute, also known as the Advanced Technology Research Institute, was established in April 2006 and is responsible for the organization and management of the university's national defence science and technology projects. The research institute has received several certifications to conduct research for military applications. It conducts research in collaboration with the former PLA General Armaments Department, SASTIND, and state-owned defence conglomerates in the fields of aviation, aerospace, electronics, nuclear technology, and shipbuilding.JLU's State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials (超硬材料国家重点实验室) works closely with China's nuclear weapons complex, the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP). Job advertisements for a CAEP subsidiary, the Center for High Pressure Science & Technology Advanced Research (北京高压科学研究中心) state that it has a branch within Jilin University. This suggests that CAEP may even be involved in managing the State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials.The university hosts at least two defence research labs, located in the university's College of Computer Science and Technology and in the College of Chemistry. Its Key Laboratory of Attack and Defense Simulation Technology for Naval Warfare, Ministry of Education (海战场攻防对抗仿真技术教育部重点实验室（B类）) is involved in cybersecurity research for the Navy. The lab's academic committee is headed by a computer scientist from China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, a leading state-owned missile manufacturer.JLU holds secret-level security credentials, allowing it to participate in research and production for classified weapons and defence technology projects.",

The university developed the Tianhe-2A supercomputer at the National Supercomputing Center in Guangzhou, the world's fastest supercomputer from 2013 to 2016. NUDT's Tianhe-1A supercomputer is based at Hunan University's National Supercomputing Center Changsha (国家超级计算长沙中心).For over a decade, NUDT has aggressively leveraged overseas expertise and resources to build its capabilities. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute's International Cyber Policy Centre's October 2018 report ‘Picking flowers, making honey: The Chinese military's collaboration with foreign universities' documented and analysed NUDT's overseas presence. The report found that by 2013 the university had sent over 1,600 of its professors and students to study and work abroad. Universities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Singapore, the Netherlands and Germany engage in some of the highest levels of collaboration with NUDT. Some of NUDT's leading experts on drone swarms, hypersonic missiles, supercomputers, radars, navigation and quantum physics have been sent to study or work abroad.Defected Chinese spy Wang Liqiang claimed in 2019 that NUDT's ‘Intelligence Center' sent him fake passports for his mission to interfere in Taiwanese politics. This indicates that the university plays an important role in supporting China's overseas intelligence activity.NUDT also works with foreign technology companies. Google and Microsoft have both worked with and trained NUDT scientists.",

      "description": "The Naval Research Academy was established in July 2017 following Xi Jinping's military reforms. Main areas of study include military theory and technological research as well as the maritime environment and national defence engineering.The Naval Research Academy actively collaborates with civilian universities as part of China's military-civil fusion program. In April 2019, delegates from the Naval Research Academy attended a meeting with officials from Xi'an Jiaotong University on co-operation directed at improving the quality assurance and technological reliability of complex armaments currently in service in the PLA Navy. Major General Li Wei from the Naval Research Academy stated that his colleagues were paying ‘very close attention to this co-operation with Xi'an Jiaotong University' in the development and sustainment of naval equipment.The Naval Research Academy also collaborates with civilian research institutes. For example, the Institute for Industrial Military-Civil Fusion at the Research Institute of Machinery Industry Economic and Management claims to have worked with the Naval Research Academy and a number of state-owned enterprises that focus on defence technology such as China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC) in order to develop strategies for military-civil fusion.The Naval Research Academy's involvement in military-civil fusion is particularly notable for work on maritime information technology and equipment. In January 2019, delegates from the Naval Research Academy attended a conference hosted by the National Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Science and Technology (水声技术国防科技重点实验室) and the Key Laboratory of Marine Information Acquisition and Security Industry and Information Technology (海洋信息获取与安全工业和信息化部重点实验室) of Harbin Engineering University (HEU). The Naval Research Academy's Liu Qingyu (刘清宇) was reported to have made a presentation on international and domestic developments in marine sonar technology at the conference.Liu Qingyu from the Naval Research Academy has a particularly strong record of engagement with civilian and military institutions for his research into marine sonar technology. In 2018, Liu delivered a presentation to the Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) which ‘elaborated on some of the problems facing the national costal defence industry' and ‘suggested areas for future research into marine acoustics.' Both students and academics from NPU attended Liu's presentation. Liu has also published papers on acoustic science with scholars from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Naval University of Engineering, and Northwestern Polytechnical University.",

The National Key Laboratory for Vessel Integrated Power System Technology (舰船综合电力技术国防科技重点实验室), which was established in 2010 to carry out ‘indigenous research and development' into integrated electric propulsion (IEP) systems that power naval vessels at sea. IEP generally uses diesel generators and/or gas turbines to generate the electricity needed in order to turn propellers on large surface vessels such as guided missile destroyers or amphibious assault ships. The lab is jointly run by NUE and China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation's (CSIC) 712th Research Institute.Rear Admiral Ma Weiming has led the National Key Laboratory for Vessel Integrated Power System Technology to develop propulsion systems for aircraft catapults, electromagnetic weapons and satellite launches. Admiral Ma has been referred to as ‘the father of China's electromagnetic catapult system' (中国电磁弹射之父) by official Chinese media sources.NUE's National Defense Technology Key Laboratory of Marine Vibration and Noise (船舶振动噪声国防科技重点实验室) works on acoustic quieting technology for submarines. The lab is probably jointly run with CSIC's 701st Research Institute, also known as China Ship Development and Design Center (中国舰船研究设计中心).Another laboratory that conducts defence research at NUE is the Nuclear Marine Propulsion Engineering Military Key Laboratory (舰船核动力工程军队重点实验室). The lab focuses on researching and training engineers in nuclear engineering for warships and submarines.Academic departments at the Naval University of Engineering include:",

      "description": "PKU is considered among China's most prestigious universities with a storied history. It is ranked as one of China's top two academic institutions, along with Tsinghua University. Unsurprisingly, the university has been included in a number of the PRC's educational initiatives, including as a Class A institution under the Double First-Class University program.PKU has been subject to at least two joint-supervision agreements between the Ministry of Education and defence industry agency SASTIND. These agreements, signed in 2012 and 2016, are designed to deepen the university's involvement in defence research.PKU's Advanced Technology Institute was founded in 2006 to oversee and develop the university's defence research. Includes several research centres and supervises the university's four major defence laboratories. The institute's research covers semiconductors, nuclear technology, quantum physics, advanced materials, underwater acoustics, satellite navigation and communications, flight propulsion, aerospace engineering and microprocessors.In 2017, PKU and the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP)—China's nuclear weapons program—established the PKU–CAEP New Structure Center for Applied Physics and Technology (北京大学-中国工程物理研究院新体制应用物理与技术研究中心).. The institution was founded on the basis of the PKU Center for Applied Physics and Technology (北京大学应用物理与技术研究中心) established with CAEP in 2007. The joint centre carries out research on materials, lasers for atomic physics applications, laser plasma physics, computer science and fluid dynamics. PKU's report on the centre notes that it will serve China's national defence needs and that CAEP's deputy director emphasised it should ‘take the path of military-civil fusion'. The joint centre's honorary director and founding director, He Xiantu, is credited as the developer of China's first neutron bomb.PKU takes precautions for the protection of classified information. The university has an office devoted to the secure handling of classified information, hosting regular meetings and training sessions to strengthen the university's security culture. In 2006, the university received security credentials for participation in classified defence research.",

In 2015, the university undertook RMB180m (AUD37m) of defence research projects, placing it among the Ministry of Education universities most involved in defence research. That figure has almost certainly grown since 2016, when SEU came under a ‘joint construction' agreement between the Ministry of Education and defence industry agency SASTIND. The university has secret security credentials, enabling it to participate in secret defence projects.The university has also been linked to cyberespionage. Researchers at its School of Cyber Science and Engineering (网络空间安全学院) have been funded by the MSS, China's civilian intelligence agency. The School of Cyber Science and Engineering has close ties to TopSec, a Chinese information security company that trains, recruits and works with PLA cyber security officers.SEU states that its defence research relies on its excellence in electronics. It has at least two laboratories that specialise in defence research on navigation technology and underwater acoustics. Both laboratories may be involved in developing technology for underwater warfare. Representatives from the PLA Navy's Submarine Academy visited SEU in 2017.SEU has also built relationships with state-owned defence conglomerates. In 2017, the university signed a strategic cooperation agreement with missile-manufacturer China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation. In 2018 and 2019, it signed similar agreements with subsidiaries of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, China's leading manufacturer of military electronics.",

Not only its dedicated defence laboratories but also a range of key laboratories and research institutions at the university have received funding from the military. Since at least 2012, Tsinghua has also been jointly supervised by defence industry agency SASTIND as part of a program to deepen its defence research and links to the defence sector.Tsinghua's defence research covers areas such as artificial intelligence, air-to-air missiles, navigation technology, instrument science and materials science.The university trains students for China's nuclear weapons program, military and defence industry. In 2014 it signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP)—China's nuclear weapons program.  In 2016, CAEP's Materials Institute and Tsinghua established a joint postgraduate training base for teaching, research collaboration and equipment sharing.Approximately 200 postgraduate students at Tsinghua are sponsored by CAEP or defence industry conglomerates each year through the Chinese government's National Defence Science and Technology Scholarship program. Scholarship recipients are required to work for their sponsoring organisation for five years after graduating. Roughly 2000 of the scholarships are awarded each year, indicating that Tsinghua students are among the primary recipients of them. Documents published by Tsinghua indicate that CAEP planned to sponsor 40 PhD students to study nuclear technology in 2013. CAEP continues to sponsor Tsinghua postgraduates. In 2004, Tsinghua agreed to supervise doctoral students from the PLA's Second Artillery Engineering University, now known as the Rocket Force University of Engineering.",

      "description": "UESTC was established in 1961 as one of China's first defence industry universities. It is now subordinate to the Ministry of Education (MOE) and is also jointly supervised by defence industry agencies MIIT and SASTIND, as well as the Chinese military's leading electronics manufacturer, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC).The university is one of China's leading universities for defence electronics research. It claims to rank among the top MOE universities in terms of the scale of its defence research. Between 2011 and 2015, its annual spending on defence research grew by 210% to RMB400 million (AUD80 million) and may account for as much as 32% of its overall research spending. 16.43% of UESTC graduates in 2017 who found employment were working in the defence sector. UESTC gained secret-level security credentials about a decade ago, probably in 2006, making it one of the first MOE universities to hold them.UESTC research has been used by state-owned manufacturers of military aircraft, missiles, and military electronics and the PLA Navy on projects such as the JF-17 fighter and the Navy's aircraft carrier program.UESTC's defence research covers areas including electronics, microwaves, terahertz technology, anti-jamming technology and signal processing, communication systems, military-use critical materials, optoelectric imaging. Between 2001 and 2005, UESTC undertook over 900 military electronics projects worth in excess of RMB500 million (AUD104 million).UESTC's research on artificial intelligence has attracted scrutiny for its human rights implications. In 2015, a professor recruited by UESTC through the Thousand Talents Plan established a company called Koala AI. The company produces artificial intelligence surveillance systems that are used in Xinjiang, where an estimated 1.5 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have disappeared into concentration camps.UESTC has close relationships with the Chinese defence industry. The university operates a national laboratory on high-power radiation with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics, the PRC's primary nuclear warhead research complex. CETC, a state-owned defence conglomerate, partnered jointly with the MOE to developUESTC's capabilities. Under the arrangement, UESTC agreed to expand its collaboration with CETC, help train CETC personnel and send its best students to work at CETC. Defence industry agency SASTIND also signed agreements to supervise UESTC in 2008 and 2016.",

In 1964 it was designated as a ‘national key university', and this appears to be the evidence it uses to claim it is a Ministry of Education university. However, the university does not appear on the Ministry of Education's list of subordinate universities.Individuals formerly and presently affiliated with the university have also held affiliations with the MSS or the MSS-linked think tank the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (中国现代国际关系研究院). They include Geng Huichang (耿惠昌), a former Minister of State Security (2007-2016) and vice minister of State Security (1998-2007). Prior to this he was the head of  China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations from 1992 to 1998. From 1990 to 1992, he was the director of UIR's American Research Department and from 1985-1990 he was deputy director of the American Research department.  Notably, current UIR President Tao Jian is also a former CICIR vice-president and a UIR graduate.UIR gives the MSS a way to work with foreign universities and academics to shape and learn about perceptions of the PRC's views on security. It also provides a platform for the MSS to identify talent, recruit officers and collect intelligence.The university's Hangzhou campus, also known as the Zhejiang Second People's Police School, may carry out more practical training of MSS officers and has been described on a local government website as ‘specialising in training special talent'. Some graduates of the Hangzhou campus have moved straight into MSS positions. The Hangzhou campus works closely with Zhejiang University on teaching and research.",
